# Day 1 – OS and SOC Context

## What is an Operating System?
An operating system is responsible for managing hardware resources, running processes, handling memory, and providing user interaction with the system.

## Why Linux is Critical in Cybersecurity
Linux powers most servers, firewalls, SOC tools, and cloud infrastructure. A SOC analyst must understand Linux to investigate attacks on production systems.

## Why Kali Linux Exists
Kali Linux is a security-focused Linux distribution that includes pre-installed security and monitoring tools. It is used for security testing and analysis.

## SOC Analyst Perspective
From a SOC standpoint:
- Linux systems generate logs that indicate authentication attempts, process execution, and network activity.
- Understanding Linux helps identify brute-force attacks, privilege abuse, and system compromise.

## Commands Executed Today
- whoami: Identifies the current user
- pwd: Shows the current working directory
- hostname: Identifies the system on a network

## Key Takeaway
A SOC analyst does not need to master Linux on Day 1, but must understand how to observe, collect evidence, and interpret system behavior.
